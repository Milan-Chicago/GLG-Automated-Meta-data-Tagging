       "' CNNA new poll finds that many Americans are not optimistic about what the GOP health care bill will do to their coverage.   Although President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress promise that their plan will cover more people and cost less, nearly half of Americans dont believe it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Wednesday.   And while many Republicans are confident that defunding Planned Parenthood is the right move, the greater majority oppose that idea, it says. This is the latest poll on the legislation from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.   The organization polled Americans from March 612, before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released an estimate Monday predicting that  unlike Obamacare, which brought the uninsured rate to an alltime low  the GOP bill will send the countrys uninsured rate higher than before the Affordable Care Act.   That change could be immediate for 14 million Americans who could become uninsured next year, according to the report. Of the more than 1,200 nationally representative random Americans polled, Kaiser found that 48 think the GOP plan will cover fewer people, compared with the one in five who said the bill would increase coverage.   Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to lower costs with their health care plans, but nearly half 48 of Americans polled think the bill will increase costs for people who buy their own insurance, while 23 think it will lower costs.   The thinking falls along p'"
